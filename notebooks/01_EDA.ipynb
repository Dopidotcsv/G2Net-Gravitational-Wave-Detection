Although, these limits are for visualization purposes only, it helps us see some peaks for each observatory. A particular frequency can be peculiar in one measurement but remember that the GW signal has to be detected in all three waves to be confirmed. This data here still seems a bit noisy and as showed in the tutorial, if sampled for longer periods of time (on real data), it can give some valuable insights.
